# 👋 Hello developer!
This project contains a basic HTML structure to get you started. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp). 🦄


## 🏗 What's next?

Build your project however you like using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Use these four files as your starting point:

- **README.md:** This is the file that you are reading now. You can leave information to others about your website.
- **index.html:** This is the default page for your space, where you write HTML, the standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **styles.css:** Use the CSS file to style your content and change the look of your space with beautiful colors, fonts and much more. 
- **scripts.js:** Use this file to make your website dynamic and interactive with JavaScript. 

> **Note:** The **styles.css** and **scripts.js** files link into the **index.html** file so that they are all connected.


## 🎨 Where to find everything
